# Getting hand's on with how clone an existing aws-amplify repo and run locally

1. clone the repo
2. npm i
3. amplify configure (set up the aws profile. For this demo to work, use the access key and secret key I provided, I will text you)
4. amplify init (brings back the current cloud setting and set up local environment, set it up with your aws profile, that has access to it)
5. npm start
6. It should now be up and running and connected to cloud!

You can go to F12 and view the network panel to monitor data.

Please refrain from calling other amplify related function, such as amplify update and amplify rebuild, since me myself haven't really figured out how they work. 

Node, the aws credentials are for my aws cloud. I can't mess with the company's site.
