# Getting hand's on with how clone an existing aws-amplify repo and run locally

1. clone the repo
2. npm i
3. amplify configure (set up the aws profile. For this demo to work, use the access key and secret key I provided below to set up a new profile)
4. amplify init (brings back the current cloud setting and set up local environment, set it up with your aws profile, that has access to it)
5. npm start
6. It should now be up and running and connected to cloud!

You can go to F12 and view the network panel to monitor data.

For your testing purpose, I'm providing you access key and secret key for my own aws. (I can't really mess with our gamein's site)
